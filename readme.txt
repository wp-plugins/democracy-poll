Adds an AJAX democratic polls to you site. Visitors can vote more than one answer & add ther own answers.


== Description ==

This plugin adds a clever and convenient system to create various Polls with different features, such as:

* Single voting
* Multiple voting
* Poll with ability to add new answers by visitors
* Poll with the specified date of the end
* You can block vote function for unregistered users
* You can choose different design of a poll
* and so on. See changelog

Democracy Poll works with cache plugins: WP Total Cache, WP Super Cache, WordFence, Quick Cache etc.

I focus on "easy-admin" features & fast performance. So you will have:

* Quick Edit button for Admin, right above a poll
* Plugin menu in toolbar
* Inline css & js incuding
* Css & js connection only where it's needed
* and so on. See changelog

### More Info ###

This plugin is a reborn of once-has-been-famous Democracy Poll. Even if it hasn't been updated since far-far away 2006, it still has the great idea of adding users' own answers. So here's a completely new code, I have left only the idea and great name of the original DP by Andrew Sutherland.

What can it perform?

* adding new polls;
* works with cache plugins: wp total cache, wp super cache, etc...
* users may add their own answers (Democracy), the option may be disabled if necessary;
* multi-voting: users may multiple answers instead of a single one (may be disabled on demand);
* closing the poll after the date specified beforehand;
* showing a random poll when some are available;
* closing polls for still unregistered users;
* a comfortable editing of a selected poll: 'Edit' key for administrators;
* votes amount editing;
* a user can change his opinion when re-vote option is enabled;
* remember users by their IP, cookies, WP profiles (for authorized users). The vote history may be cleaned up;
* inserting new polls to any posts: the [demÐ¾cracy] (shortcode). A key in visual editor is available for this function;
* a widget (may be disabled);
* convenient polls editing: the plugin's Panel is carried out to the WordPress toolbar; (may be disabled);
* .css or .js files may be disabled or embedded to HTML code;
* showing a note under the poll: a short text with any notes to the poll or anything around it;
* changing the poll design (css themes);
* primary interface is Russian, but Enlglish interface is also available.
